RedHerd is a collaborative and serverless framework for orchestrating a geographically distributed group of assets capable of conducting simulating complex offensive cyberspace operations.

The framework takes advantage of the "as a Service" paradigm in order to deploy a ready-to-use infrastructure that can also be adopted for effective training purposes, by reliably reproducing a real-world cyberspace scenario in which red and blue teams can challenge each other. RedHerd perfectly fits the Open Systems Architecture design pattern, thanks to the adoption of both open standards and wide-spread open source software components.
