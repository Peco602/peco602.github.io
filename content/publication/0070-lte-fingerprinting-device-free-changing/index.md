abstract: This paper proposes a fingerprinting-based device Free Passive localization system based on the use of the LTE signal and it is robust to environment changes. The proposed methodology uses as fingerprints descriptors calculated on the CSI vectors rather than directly CSI vectors. The paper shows the performance of the proposed methods also assuming that the monitored environment might be different from the one characterized during the training phase as some equipment may be moved. Moreover, the paper compares the proposed method with signal fingerprinting approaches based on RSSI or direct CSI vectors. Experimental results, which consider one single LTE receiver in the monitored room, show the effectiveness of the proposed solution.
