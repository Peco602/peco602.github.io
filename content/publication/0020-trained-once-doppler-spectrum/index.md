abstract: This paper presents a WiFi-based device-free crowd counting and occupancy estimation system that can be used in rooms/environments different from the ones in which the training process has been performed. Therefore, crowd counting is achieved without requiring another training phase in each new environment. The proposed approach analyzes the shape of the Doppler spectrum of the received signal which is correlated to the number of people moving in the monitored environment. Unlike a radar-like approach, the use of a reference signal is not required. Experimental results are presented for two different rooms/environments without any constraint on the movements of the volunteers.
